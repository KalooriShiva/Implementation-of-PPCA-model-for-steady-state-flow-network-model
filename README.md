This repository delves into the exploration of efficient feature extraction and capturing the underlying structure of flow network systems. It implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms to identify the steady-state flow network model.
